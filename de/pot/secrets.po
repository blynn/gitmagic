"How can Git be so unobtrusive? Aside from occasional commits and merges, you "
"can work as if you were unaware that version control exists. That is, until "
"you need it, and that's when you're glad Git was watching over you the whole "
"time."

"Other version control systems force you to constantly struggle with red tape "
"and bureaucracy. Permissions of files may be read-only unless you explicitly "
"tell a central server which files you intend to edit. The most basic "
"commands may slow to a crawl as the number of users increases. Work grinds "
"to a halt when the network or the central server goes down."

"In contrast, Git simply keeps the history of your project in the `.git` "

"saved state from `.git` at any time."

"We stated earlier that the index is a staging area. Why is a bunch of file "

"Git is 'content-addressable': files are not stored according to their "
"filename, but rather by the hash of the data they contain, in a file we call "
