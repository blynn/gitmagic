"There are some Git issues I've swept under the carpet. Some can be handled "
"easily with scripts and hooks, some require reorganizing or redefining the "
"project, and for the few remaining annoyances, one will just have to wait. "
"Or better yet, pitch in and help!"

"As time passes, cryptographers discover more and more SHA1 weaknesses. "
"Already, finding hash collisions is feasible for well-funded organizations. "
"Within years, perhaps even a typical PC will have enough computing power to "
"silently corrupt a Git repository."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:26
msgid ""
"If your project is very large and contains many unrelated files that are "
"constantly being changed, Git may be disadvantaged more than other systems "
"because single files are not tracked. Git tracks changes to the whole "
"project, which is usually beneficial."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:28
msgid ""
"A solution is to break up your project into pieces, each consisting of "
"related files. Use *git submodule* if you still want to keep everything in a "
"single repository."

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:32
msgid ""
"Some version control systems force you to explicitly mark a file in some way "
"before editing. While this is especially annoying when this involves talking "
"to a central server, it does have two benefits:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '  1. '
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:34
msgid "Diffs are quick because only the marked files need be examined."
msgstr ""

#. type: Bullet: '  2. '
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:36
msgid ""
"One can discover who else is working on the file by asking the central "
"server who has marked it for editing."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:38
msgid ""
"With appropriate scripting, you can achieve the same with Git. This requires "
"cooperation from the programmer, who should execute particular scripts when "
"editing a file."

msgid "=== File History ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:42
msgid ""
"Since Git records project-wide changes, reconstructing the history of a "
"single file requires more work than in version control systems that track "
"individual files."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:44
msgid ""
"The penalty is typically slight, and well worth having as other operations "
"are incredibly efficient. For example, `git checkout` is faster than `cp -"
"a`, and project-wide deltas compress better than collections of file-based "
"deltas."

msgid "=== Initial Clone ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:48
msgid ""
"Creating a clone is more expensive than checking out code in other version "
"control systems when there is a lengthy history."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:50
msgid ""
"The initial cost is worth paying in the long run, as most future operations "
"will then be fast and offline. However, in some situations, it may be "
"preferable to create a shallow clone with the `--depth` option. This is much "
"faster, but the resulting clone has reduced functionality."

msgid "=== Volatile Projects ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:54
msgid ""
"Git was written to be fast with respect to the size of the changes. Humans "
"make small edits from version to version. A one-liner bugfix here, a new "
"feature there, emended comments, and so forth. But if your files are "
"radically different in successive revisions, then on each commit, your "
"history necessarily grows by the size of your whole project."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:56
msgid ""
"There is nothing any version control system can do about this, but standard "
"Git users will suffer more since normally histories are cloned."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:58
msgid ""
"The reasons why the changes are so great should be examined. Perhaps file "
"formats should be changed. Minor edits should only cause minor changes to at "
"most a few files."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:60
msgid ""
"Or perhaps a database or backup/archival solution is what is actually being "
"sought, not a version control system. For example, version control may be "
"ill-suited for managing photos periodically taken from a webcam."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:62
msgid ""
"If the files really must be constantly morphing and they really must be "
"versioned, a possibility is to use Git in a centralized fashion. One can "
"create shallow clones, which checks out little or no history of the project. "
"Of course, many Git tools will be unavailable, and fixes must be submitted "
"as patches. This is probably fine as it's unclear why anyone would want the "
"history of wildly unstable files."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:64
msgid ""
"Another example is a project depending on firmware, which takes the form of "
"a huge binary file. The history of the firmware is uninteresting to users, "
"and updates compress poorly, so firmware revisions would unnecessarily blow "
"up the size of the repository."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:66
msgid ""
"In this case, the source code should be stored in a Git repository, and the "
"binary file should be kept separately. To make life easier, one could "
"distribute a script that uses Git to clone the code, and rsync or a Git "
"shallow clone for the firmware."
msgstr ""

msgid "=== Global Counter ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:70
msgid ""
"Some centralized version control systems maintain a positive integer that "
"increases when a new commit is accepted. Git refers to changes by their "
"hash, which is better in many circumstances."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:72
msgid ""
"But some people like having this integer around. Luckily, it's easy to write "
"scripts so that with every update, the central Git repository increments an "
"integer, perhaps in a tag, and associates it with the hash of the latest "
"commit."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:74
msgid ""
"Every clone could maintain such a counter, but this would probably be "
"useless, since only the central repository and its counter matters to "
"everyone."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:76
msgid "=== Empty Subdirectories ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:78
msgid ""
"Empty subdirectories cannot be tracked. Create dummy files to work around "
"this problem."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:80
msgid ""
"The current implementation of Git, rather than its design, is to blame for "
"this drawback. With luck, once Git gains more traction, more users will "
"clamour for this feature and it will be implemented."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:82
msgid "=== Initial Commit ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:84
msgid ""
"A stereotypical computer scientist counts from 0, rather than 1. "
"Unfortunately, with respect to commits, git does not adhere to this "
"convention. Many commands are unfriendly before the initial commit. "
"Additionally, some corner cases must be handled specially, such as rebasing "
"a branch with a different initial commit."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:86
msgid ""
"Git would benefit from defining the zero commit: as soon as a repository is "
"constructed, HEAD would be set to the string consisting of 20 zero bytes. "
"This special commit represents an empty tree, with no parent, at some time "
"predating all Git repositories."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:88
msgid ""
"Then running git log, for example, would inform the user that no commits "
"have been made yet, instead of exiting with a fatal error. Similarly for "
"other tools."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:90
msgid "Every initial commit is implicitly a descendant of this zero commit."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:92
msgid ""
"However there are some problem cases unfortunately. If several branches with "
"different initial commits are merged together, then rebasing the result "
"requires substantial manual intervention."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:94
msgid "=== Interface Quirks ==="
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../en/drawbacks.txt:97
msgid ""
"For commits A and B, the meaning of the expressions \"A..B\" and \"A...B\" "
"depends on whether the command expects two endpoints or a range. See *git "
"help diff* and *git help rev-parse*."
